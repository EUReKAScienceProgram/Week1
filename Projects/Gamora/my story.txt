Story:
WWIII breaks out. The world prepares for Nuclear catastrophe. All babies and children are shipped away on a spacecraft tethered to the earth.

All adults are brought into various different survival bunkers around the world. Matthew, a baby, is put onto the space craft. His parents are brought into the Vancouver bunker. 





15 years later, in 2040, Matthew is 15. His spacecraft has run out of resources and the bunkers are too. It is time for the space-crafters-to return to Earth. None knew what to expect.



They land back on the world, and it is obliterated. Matthew has to find his parents, or else, they will be trapped in the bunker.
